# Call For Papers

The aim of this one-day workshop is to bring together researchers who are interested in optimizing database performance on modern computing infrastructure by designing new data management techniques and tools. 

## Topics of Interest
The continued evolution of computing hardware and infrastructure imposes new challenges and bottlenecks to program performance. As a result, traditional database architectures that focus solely on I/O optimization increasingly fail to utilize hardware resources efficiently.  Multi-core CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, new memory and storage technologies (such as flash and non-volatile memory), and low-power hardware imposes a great challenge to optimizing database performance. Consequently, exploiting the characteristics of modern hardware has become an important topic of database systems research.

The goal is to make database systems adapt automatically to the sophisticated hardware characteristics, thus maximizing performance transparently to applications. To achieve this goal, the data management community needs interdisciplinary collaboration with computer architecture, compiler, operating systems and storage researchers. This involves rethinking traditional data structures, query processing algorithms, and database software architectures to adapt to the advances in the underlying hardware infrastructure.

We seek submissions bridging the area of database systems to computer architecture, compilers, and operating systems. In particular, submissions covering topics from the following non-exclusive list are encouraged:

- database algorithms and data structures on modern hardware
- cost models and query optimization for novel hierarchical memory systems
- hardware systems for query processing
- data management using co-processors
- novel application of new storage technologies to data management
- query processing using computing power in storage systems
- database architectures for low-power computing and embedded devices
- database architectures on multi-threaded and chip multiprocessors
- performance analysis of database workloads on modern hardware
- compiler and operating systems advances to improve database performance
- new benchmarks for micro-architectural evaluation of database workloads
- taking advantage of modern network capabilities for data processing

## Submission Tracks
We invite submissions to two tracks:

1) Full papers: A full paper must be no longer than 6 pages excluding the bibliography.  There is no limit on the length of the bibliography. Full papers describe a complete work in the area of data management for new hardware. Accepted papers will be given 10 pages (plus bibliography) for the camera-ready version and a long presentation slot during the workshop.

2) Short Papers: Short papers must not exceed 2 pages excluding the bibliography. Short papers describe very early stage works or summaries of mature systems. Short papers will be included in the proceedings, given 4 pages (plus bibliography) for the camera-ready version, and may be given a short presentation slot during the workshop.

All accepted papers (full and short) will also be presented as posters during a workshop poster session.

## Best of DaMoN {{ cookiecutter.workshop_year }}
This year all accepted DaMoN papers will be considered for a best paper award. 

We intend to invite extended versions of a selection of DaMoN'23 papers for submission to the VLDB Journal. Extended papers that are accepted by the VLDB Journal will appear in a special “Best of DaMoN {{ cookiecutter.workshop_year }}” section within one of the regular VLDBJ issues.

## Important Dates
Paper submission: TBD, {{ cookiecutter.workshop_year }} (11:59pm AoE)

Notification of acceptance: TBD, {{ cookiecutter.workshop_year }}

Camera-ready copies: TBD, {{ cookiecutter.workshop_year }}

Workshop: {{ cookiecutter.workshop_date }}

## Submission Instructions
Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research papers that are not being considered for publication in any other forum. Manuscripts should be submitted electronically as PDF files using the latest [ACM paper format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) consistent with the [ACM SIGMOD formatting guidelines](https://{{ cookiecutter.workshop_year }}.sigmod.org/calls_papers_sigmod_research.shtml) to the DaMoN {{ cookiecutter.workshop_year }} CMT site, at https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DaMoN{{ cookiecutter.workshop_year }}. Submissions will be reviewed in a single-blind manner. Submissions that are 2 pages or shorter excluding the bibliography will be reviewed as short papers. Submissions that are 6 pages or shorter excluding the bibliography will be reviewed as full papers. Submissions that are longer than 6 pages excluding the bibliography will be desk-rejected.

Accepted papers will be included within the informal online proceedings at the website. Additionally, all accepted papers will be published online in the ACM Digital Library. Therefore, the papers must include the standard ACM copyright notice on the first page.
